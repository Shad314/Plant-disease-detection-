# Plant-disease-detection-

Main aim of this project was early detection of plant diseases and thus prevent and control it for crop production.Generally, there is a visible pattern present
on the diseased crop which can be considered as an abnormality. Leaves are common examples of primary sources for identifying plant diseases.Its a quite
famous classification problem so what we did was coded different deep learning architectures to solve this problem and in the end we compared them on different
evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision and recall to know which of them performed the best.
